# How I started

First I tried to find which sort of cipher is given and for that I use https://www.decode.fr/en website and there I got to know that the given format can be changed into ASCII with octal format


 -> aHR0cHM6Ly8yMDcuMjI4LjIzOC43
 In this format I took just the numbers. I go after 6.8.4.43 as the question is asking for the location. Then I immediately lookup the ipaddress for the location where I get the info of latitude and longitude. I got to find the location on US with the actual address of Cheney Reservior and Kansas State. Hence the flag is found.

# Flag
CTF-NP{United States,Kansas,Cheney Reservior}
